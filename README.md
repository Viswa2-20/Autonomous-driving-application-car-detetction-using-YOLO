# Autonomous-driving-application-car-detetction-using-YOLO
This project demonstrates how to use the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model to detect cars in images as part of an autonomous driving application. YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for multiple objects in a single evaluation.
